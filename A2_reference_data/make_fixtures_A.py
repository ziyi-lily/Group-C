PE6201 · A2 · PROBLEM A — reference dataset generator
=====================================================
Health-insurance claim first response.

WHAT THIS IS
    A small, deterministic set of records standing in for the systems of record a
    claims agent would query. Running this script writes the JSON files your tools
    read. The JSON is also committed, so you are not blocked if you cannot run this.

WHAT IT IS FOR
    Two things, and the second matters more than the first.
    1. It gives you working data on day one.
    2. It SHOWS YOU THE PATTERN so you can add your own records - which you will
       have to, because a 30-50 case evaluation set with 6-10 negative cases needs
       records that trigger those negatives, and inventing them is part of the work.

HOW THE FILES CONNECT  (this is the part worth reading twice)
    A claim does not carry the member's policy or the hospital's panel status. It
    carries IDS, and your agent follows them:

        claims.member_id    ->  members.member_id      (who claimed)
        members.policy_id   ->  policies.policy_id     (are they covered, and how much is left)
        claims.hospital_id  ->  hospitals.hospital_id  (panel or not)
        claim line .code    ->  procedures.code        (is this procedure covered at all)
        procedures.requires_preauth == True
                            ->  preauthorisations      (matched on member_id + procedure_code)

    Break one of those correspondences in a record you invent - a claim whose
    member_id matches nobody - and your agent will look perfectly sound and return
    nothing.

RULES IF YOU EXTEND IT
    * KEEP the records shipped here. A marker re-runs your harness against them.
    * COMMIT whatever generates or holds your additions, so your data is
      reproducible rather than a mystery.
    * ADD new rows with NEW ids; never edit or delete a shipped row. The EXTRA_*
      lists at the bottom are where your additions go, and the comment above them
      says which table each kind of new case needs.
    * Do not hand-edit the JSON - that is where malformed data comes from.
    * Run check_my_data.py afterwards. It catches an id that resolves to nothing.

# Claims already decided. Nothing in CLAIMS above has been decided yet - this table
# is the HISTORY your agent checks against, and CLM-8933 is the resubmission of the
# one record in it.
# Claims history. FOUR rows, and only the first is a true duplicate of anything in
# the queue. The other three are NEAR-MISSES, and they are here for a reason.
#
# WHY NEAR-MISSES. With a one-row history, CLM-8933 was the only claim in the set
# dated 2026-08-20 - so an agent matching on date_of_service ALONE scored 15/15,
# exactly as well as one matching on all four facts. The rule the brief teaches
# (same member + same hospital + same date + same lines = the same episode) was
# never actually tested. Member-only and hospital-only matching were already punished - four
# claims share M-2214, six share H-114 - but nothing forced a lines comparison.
#
# Each near-miss below fails on exactly ONE fact, so a sloppy matcher produces a
# false positive and a careful one does not. None of them changes a shipped label:
# all three are correctly NOT duplicates.

# ONE RULE: ADD NEW ROWS WITH NEW IDS. NEVER EDIT OR DELETE A SHIPPED ROW.
#
#     A marker re-runs your harness against the records above, and the answer key
#     is written against them. Change one and your results stop being comparable
#     with anyone else's - including your own from last week.
#
# MOST of your evaluation set is new CLAIMS, and for many cases a claim is all you
# need: a different line count, a different procedure, a different date, a
# different hospital, a narrative that tries something new.
#
# BUT SOME CASES CANNOT BE BUILT FROM A CLAIM ALONE, because the thing that makes
# them interesting lives in a supporting table. There is one lapsed policy, one
# exclusion rule and one TRUE duplicate in the shipped data (decided_claims has
# four rows, but three are near-misses that must not be flagged), so a set built only
# from EXTRA_CLAIMS will keep re-testing the same three facts. If you want:
#
#   a SECOND duplicate case          -> add to EXTRA_DECIDED  (and a claim matching it)
#   a different exclusion rule       -> add to EXTRA_POLICIES (new policy_id) + EXTRA_MEMBERS
#   a second lapsed policy           -> add to EXTRA_POLICIES + EXTRA_MEMBERS
#   a new pre-authorisation scenario -> add to EXTRA_PREAUTHORISATIONS
#   a document rule you invented     -> add to EXTRA_REQUIRED_DOCS
#   a procedure of your own          -> add to EXTRA_PROCEDURES (set requires_preauth
#                                       yourself - that flag drives the loop)
#
# Whatever you add, EVERY ID MUST RESOLVE. A claim whose member_id matches nobody
# will make your agent look perfectly sound and return nothing. Run
# check_my_data.py after every change - it catches exactly that.
#
# And LABEL what you add, in your own copy of the answer key. An unlabelled case
# cannot be scored.
